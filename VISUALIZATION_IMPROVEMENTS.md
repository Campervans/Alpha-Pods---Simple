# Visualization and CLI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. **Performance Chart Improvements** (`src/gui/visualization.py`)
- **Thinner Lines**: Added `marker='dot'` to both plot lines for cleaner appearance
- **Compact Size**: Reduced chart size from 100x30 to 80x20 for better terminal fit
- **Better Readability**: Maintained grid and colors while making lines less thick

### 2. **Cleaned Up CLI Output** (`src/gui/app.py`)
- **Removed Duplicate Tables**: Eliminated redundant results tables after optimization
- **Focus on Results**: CLEIR optimization now shows only the comparison chart and table
- **Consistent Behavior**: Both CVaR and CLEIR optimizations now have clean output

### 3. **Reduced Verbose Messages** (`src/gui/controllers.py`)
- **Universe Selection**: Replaced detailed liquidity statistics with simple confirmation
- **Warning Messages**: Converted print statements to rich console with color coding
- **Clean Progress**: Minimized noise during stock selection process
