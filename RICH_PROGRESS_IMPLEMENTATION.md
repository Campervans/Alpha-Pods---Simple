# Rich Progress Display Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented rich progress displays for the CLEIR and CVaR optimization processes using the `rich` Python package.

## Changes Made

### 1. **CLEIR Solver** (`src/optimization/cleir_solver.py`)
- Added rich progress bars for:
  - Problem setup phase
  - Solver attempts (shows which solver is being tried)
- Color-coded output:
  - Cyan for setup tasks
  - Yellow for solver attempts
  - Green for success messages
  - Orange for warnings
  - Red for failures

### 2. **CVaR Solver** (`src/optimization/cvar_solver.py`)
- Similar progress bars as CLEIR:
  - Problem setup phase
  - Solver attempts with progress tracking
- Consistent color scheme with CLEIR solver

### 3. **Backtest Engine** (`src/backtesting/engine.py`)
- Added overall backtest progress bar showing rebalancing progress
- Converted all print statements to use rich console with colors
- Added `show_optimization_progress` flag to control verbosity
- Progress bar shows:
  - Current rebalancing date
  - Progress through total number of rebalances
  - Time elapsed

### 4. **GUI Controllers** (`src/gui/controllers.py`)
- Updated to enable optimization progress displays when running from GUI
- Added rich console import for future enhancements

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.optimization.cleir_solver import solve_cleir
from src.optimization.cvar_solver import solve_cvar

# Progress bars are shown when verbose=True
weights, info = solve_cleir(returns, benchmark, config, verbose=True)
weights, info = solve_cvar(returns, config, verbose=True)
```

### Backtest Usage
```python
from src.backtesting.engine import CVaRIndexBacktest

# Control optimization progress display
backtest = CVaRIndexBacktest(
    price_data=data,
    optimization_config=config,
    show_optimization_progress=True  # Show detailed progress
)
```

## Visual Features

1. **Progress Bars**: Show completion percentage and time elapsed
2. **Spinners**: Indicate active processes
3. **Color Coding**:
   - ðŸŸ¦ Blue: General information
   - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Active processes
   - ðŸŸ© Green: Success messages
   - ðŸŸ§ Orange: Warnings
   - ðŸŸ¥ Red: Errors
4. **Task Descriptions**: Clear descriptions of current operations

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can see exactly what the system is doing
2. **Performance Insights**: Time tracking helps identify bottlenecks
3. **Debugging**: Progress indicators help identify where issues occur
4. **Professional Appearance**: Rich formatting makes the output more polished

## Test Scripts

- `scripts/test_rich_progress.py`: Tests individual solver progress displays
- `scripts/test_backtest_progress.py`: Tests full backtest with progress tracking

## Dependencies

The `rich` package is already included in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = [
    ...
    "rich>=13.0.0",
    ...
]
```
