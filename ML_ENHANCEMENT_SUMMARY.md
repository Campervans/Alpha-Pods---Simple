# ML Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the ML enhancement implementation for Task B, which adds a simple but robust machine learning alpha overlay to the baseline CVaR/CLEIR portfolio optimization system.

## Files Created

### 1. Feature Engineering Module
- **File**: `src/features/simple_features.py`
- **Purpose**: Creates 7 technical indicators from price and volume data
- **Features**:
  - 3 momentum features (1m, 3m, 6m returns)
  - 2 volatility features (1m, 3m rolling std)
  - 1 volume ratio feature
  - 1 RSI indicator

### 2. Alpha Model Module
- **File**: `src/models/simple_alpha_model.py`
- **Purpose**: Ridge regression model for return prediction
- **Key Features**:
  - Standardized features with StandardScaler
  - L2 regularization (Ridge) for stability
  - Feature importance extraction via coefficients

### 3. Walk-Forward Training Module
- **File**: `src/models/walk_forward.py`
- **Purpose**: Manages time-series model training with no look-ahead bias
- **Key Features**:
  - 3-year rolling training window
  - Quarterly rebalancing
  - Per-stock model training
  - Strict temporal separation

### 4. Alpha-Enhanced Backtest Engine
- **File**: `src/backtesting/alpha_engine.py`
- **Purpose**: Integrates ML predictions with CLEIR optimization
- **Key Features**:
  - Selects top 30 stocks based on alpha predictions
  - Runs CLEIR optimization on selected universe
  - Tracks performance metrics

### 5. Interpretability & Visualization
- **File**: `src/analysis/simple_interpretability.py`
- **Purpose**: Creates visualizations and analysis reports
- **Outputs**:
  - Feature importance plot
  - Performance comparison plot
  - ML predictions analysis
  - Performance report

### 6. Main Execution Script
- **File**: `scripts/run_simple_ml_backtest.py`
- **Purpose**: Runs the complete ML-enhanced backtest
- **Outputs**:
  - `results/ml_enhanced_index.csv` - Daily index values
  - `results/ml_feature_importance.png` - Feature importance visualization
  - `results/ml_performance_comparison.png` - Performance comparison
  - `results/ml_predictions_analysis.png` - Predictions analysis
  - `results/ml_performance_report.md` - Detailed report
  - `results/ml_portfolio_weights.csv` - Weight history
  - `results/ml_selected_universes.txt` - Selected stocks by date

### 7. Testing
- **File**: `tests/test_ml_enhancement.py`
- **Tests**:
  - SimpleAlphaModel functionality
  - Feature engineering correctness
  - No look-ahead bias verification
  - Integration tests

### 8. Method Note
- **File**: `results/ml_method_note.md`
- **Purpose**: Explains methodology in under 400 words
- **Content**: Overview, implementation details, design choices

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Simplicity First**: Used Ridge regression instead of complex models
2. **No Look-Ahead Bias**: Strict walk-forward training methodology
3. **Interpretability**: Linear model allows feature importance analysis
4. **Robustness**: Fixed parameters, no hyperparameter tuning
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing CLEIR optimizer

## How to Run

```bash
# Run the ML-enhanced backtest
python scripts/run_simple_ml_backtest.py

# Run integration tests
python scripts/test_ml_integration.py
```

## Expected Improvements

The ML enhancement is designed to improve the baseline strategy by:
- Better stock selection through predictive alpha signals
- Maintained risk management through existing CVaR/CLEIR framework
- Improved Sharpe ratio (target: 20%+ improvement)
- Interpretable results through feature importance analysis
